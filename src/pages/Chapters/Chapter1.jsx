              with a long and illustrious history. Our people have been at the

              migrants who will add to the diversity and dynamism of our

              is designed to support you in your preparation. It will help you

              community. It will also help ensure that you a have a broad 
              general knowledge of the culture, laws and history of the UK.</p>
            <h3>The values and principles of the UK</h3>
            <p>British society is founded on fundamental values and principles 
              which all those living in the UK should respect and support. These 
              values are reflected in the responsibilities, rights and 
              privileges of being a British citizen or permanent resident of the 
              UK. They are based on history and traditions and are protected by 
              law, customs and expectations. There is no place in British 
              society for extremism or intolerance.</p>
            <p>The fundamental principles of British life include:</p>
            <p>• Democracy</p>
            <p>• The rule of law</p>
            <p>• Individual liberty</p>
            <p>• Tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs</p>
            <p>• Participation in community life.</p>
            <p>As part of the citizenship ceremony, new citizens pledge to 
              uphold these values. The pledge is:</p>
            <p>‘I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its 
              rights and freedoms. I will uphold its democratic values. I will 
              observe its laws faithfully and fulfil my duties and obligations 
              as a British citizen.’</p>
            <p>Flowing from the fundamental principles are responsibilities and 
              freedoms which are shared by all those living in the UK and which 
              we expect all residents to respect.</p>
            <p>If you wish to be a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you should:</p>
            <p>• Respect and obey the law</p>
            <p>• Respect the rights of others, including their right to their 
              own opinions</p>
            <p>• Treat others with fairness</p>
            <p>• Look after yourself and your family</p>
            <p>• Look after the area in which you live and the environment.</p>
            <p>In return, the UK offers:</p>
            <p>• Freedom of belief and religion</p>
            <p>• Freedom of speech</p>
            <p>• Freedom from unfair discrimination</p>
            <p>• A right to a fair trial</p>
            <p>• A right to join in the election of a government.</p>
            <h3>Becoming a permanent resident</h3>
            <p>To apply to become a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you

            <p>• Have a good understanding of life in the UK.</p>
